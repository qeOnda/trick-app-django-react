# trick-app-django-react 
Trick App is a "to-do" list for learning skateboard tricks. You enter a trick name, type of trick and a tutorial video URL from YouTube into the app and once you learn the trick you can mark it as **completed**.  

Trick App was built using Django as the backend and React for the frontend. It is a revamped, full-stack version of an application I made earlier in my programming journey. You can find the original project live [here](https://sk8pp.herokuapp.com/home/) and the repo [here](https://github.com/qeOnda/trick-app-django).  
  
The site was deployed using Google App Engine and can be viewed here: https://trick-app-306710.nw.r.appspot.com/

## Install and run on localhost 
First clone repo:   
```
$ git clone https://github.com/qeOnda/trick-app-django-react
```
Then install React dependencies and start frontend development server: 
```
$ cd trick-app-django-react
$ cd backend/frontend
$ yarn install 
$ yarn start
```
Then install Django dependencies and start backend development server from root directory:
```
$ cd backend
$ pipenv shell 
$ pipenv install 
$ DJANGO_ENV=development python manage.py runserver
```
Now the development server will be running at localhost:8000.
